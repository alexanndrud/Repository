HOW TO PLAY: -Choose one person to be the executioner.
             -That person will think of a word or short phrase an mark out blanks (short lines) for each letter of each word.
             -Separate words with either a slash, a fairly wide gap, or place words on separate lines.
             -Then another player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word(s) then write the letter in everywhere it would appear, an cross out that letter in the alphabet.
             -If the letter isn't in the word then add a body part to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg).
             -The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word (or phrase) or all six body parts are on the gallows.

TO WIN: -The executioner wins if the full body is hanging from the gallows.
        -The guesser(s) wins if they guess the word before the person is hung.

HANGMAN EXAMPLE:

Here is an example of a hangman game in progress:
        -The phrase is Happy Birthday, so 5 blank spaces were marked out for Happy, and below that 8 blank space were marked out for birthday.
        -Three correct guesses were made: A, R and T. Three incorrect guesses were made: S, E, and M.
        -Three body parts were added for the 3 incorrect guesses.
